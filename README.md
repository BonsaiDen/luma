luma - Yet another game engine
==============================

This project will try to create a minimal, cross platform game engine scriptable in lua.

The code will be written in ANSI C and depend on the following - cross platform - libraries.

- [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) (opengl, input)
- [portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com) (sound, music)
- [lua](http://www.lua.org) (scripting)
- [libpng](http://libpng.org) and [zlib](http://zlib.net) (image loading, support)


## Setup

1. Checkout the respository and run `./setup.sh` to set up the dependencies and compile them (this is only tested on linux right now).
2. Build the engine (there's nothing to build just yet)
